Customer Behaviour and Segmentation using Supervised and Unsupervised Learning Techniques.
#INTRODUCTION
Customer retention is a critical concern for businesses in todayâ€™s competitive landscape. Predicting customer churn and identifying distinct customer segments can help companies develop targeted marketing strategies and improve customer experience.

Leveraging machine learning models to analyze customer data allows businesses to make data-driven decisions, maximizing both retention and personalized marketing efforts.
This project focuses on building predictive models to identify potential customer churn and employing clustering techniques to group customers based on behavior and preferences, utilizing Python/R for data analysis.

#OBJECTIVES
1.] Predicting Customer Churn: To develop a supervised learning model that predicts which customers are likely to churn based on historical data, allowing companies to intervene proactively.

2.] Clustering Customer Segments: To identify distinct customer segments through unsupervised learning, enabling businesses to tailor marketing strategies for different groups and enhance customer satisfaction.

These models will help businesses in creating effective marketing campaigns, reducing churn rates, and boosting customer loyalty by understanding customer behavior more deeply.

# METHODOLOGY
1.] Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Gather customer data, including demographics, usage patterns, and interactions (e.g., monthly charges, contract type, payment method).

Clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.

2.] Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Perform visualizations (heatmaps, box plots, count plots) to identify patterns in the data and understand the relationships between variables like Gender, Contract, MonthlyCharges, and Churn.

3.] Predicting Customer Churn (Supervised Learning):

Algorithm: Apply Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests to build a churn prediction model. Feature Selection: Use important features such as MonthlyCharges, Tenure, and Contract Type to predict churn. Model Evaluation: Use accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices to evaluate the model's performance.

4.] Customer Segmentation (Unsupervised Learning):

Algorithm: Implement K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering to group customers based on attributes like Income, Tenure, and MonthlyCharges. Model Evaluation: Determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method and interpret cluster characteristics.

5.] Visualization and Reporting:

Visualize churn probability with ROC curves and cluster segmentation using scatter plots and dendrograms. Present findings and insights using charts and graphs to communicate effectively with stakeholders.

# Interpretations and Insights:
1.] Churn Prediction:

The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of 85%, with high precision and recall scores, indicating it can effectively predict customer churn. Important factors driving churn include Tenure, MonthlyCharges, and Contract Type. Customers on month-to-month contracts with high charges are more likely to churn, offering an opportunity for targeted retention strategies.

2.] Customer Segmentation:

K-means clustering identified three main customer segments:

i.] High-Value Loyalists: Customers with long tenure and moderate monthly charges.

ii.] Price-Sensitive Switchers: Customers with short tenure and high monthly charges, often on month-to-month contracts.

iii.] Contractual Steady Customers: Customers on longer-term contracts with moderate monthly charges.

This segmentation enables companies to create personalized marketing strategies, such as offering loyalty rewards to high-value customers or discounts to price-sensitive customers to reduce churn.
